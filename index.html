    A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
    of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
    Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is
    layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
    rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
    results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. The modern
    croissant seems to have been created by the French chef Sylvain Claudius
    Goy. Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
    crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.Kipferls have long been a
    staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern
    croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers
    replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated
    dough.In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed
    but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by
    unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain,
    was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of
    the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from
    frozen dough. Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in
    many European countries.
